# Follow/Unfollow Functionality Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds comprehensive follow/unfollow functionality to the Instagram-Plus application, allowing users to follow and unfollow other users, discover new users, and view user profiles.

## Features Added

### 1. Backend Enhancements

#### User Model (Already existed)
- `followers`: Array of user IDs who follow this user
- `following`: Array of user IDs this user follows

#### New API Endpoints
- `PATCH /users/:id/follow` - Toggle follow/unfollow a user
- `GET /users/` - Get all users (for discovery)
- `GET /users/search/:query` - Search users by username
- `GET /users/:id` - Get user details with populated followers/following
- `GET /posts/user/:userId` - Get posts by a specific user

### 2. Frontend Components

#### Updated Home Feed (`home.jsx`)
- Added follow/unfollow buttons on each post
- Made usernames and profile pictures clickable to navigate to user profiles
- Shows current user's following status for each post author
- Prevents following own posts

#### New Discover Users Component (`DiscoverUsers.jsx`)
- Browse all users in the system
- Search users by username with debounced search
- Follow/unfollow users directly from the discovery page
- Shows follower/following counts
- Responsive design

#### New User Profile Component (`UserProfile.jsx`)
- View individual user profiles (including other users)
- See user's posts in a grid layout
- Follow/unfollow from profile page
- View follower/following statistics
- Edit profile button for own profile
- Responsive design with mobile support

#### New My Profile Component (`MyProfile.jsx`)
- View your own profile in the same format as other users
- Shows your posts, followers, and following
- Displays clickable followers/following lists (first 10 with "more" indicator)
- "Edit Profile" button that navigates to the edit page
- "Create Your First Post" button if no posts exist
- Consistent styling with other user profiles

#### Updated Navigation (`navbar.jsx`)
- Added "Discover" link to navigate to user discovery page
- Changed "Profile" to "My Profile" for clarity
- Separated profile viewing from profile editing

#### Updated App Routes (`App.jsx`)
- Added routes for `/my-profile`, `/edit-profile`, `/discover` and `/user/:userId`
- Separated profile viewing (`/my-profile`) from profile editing (`/edit-profile`)
- Protected routes requiring authentication

### 3. Styling
- Created responsive CSS for new components
- Mobile-first design approach
- Hover effects and smooth transitions
- Consistent with existing design language

## Usage

### Following Users
1. **From Home Feed**: Click the "Follow" button on any post
2. **From Discover Page**: Navigate to "Discover" and follow users
3. **From User Profile**: Click on usernames to view profiles and follow

### Discovering Users
1. Click "Discover" in the navigation
2. Browse all users or search by username
3. See follower/following counts
4. Follow/unfollow directly from the list

### Viewing Profiles
1. Click on any username or profile picture
2. View user's posts, followers, and following counts
3. Follow/unfollow from the profile page

## Technical Implementation

### Follow/Unfollow Logic
- Toggle-based system: one endpoint handles both follow and unfollow
- Updates both users' follower/following arrays
- Real-time UI updates without page refresh
- Prevents self-following

### Search Functionality
- Debounced search (300ms delay) to reduce API calls
- Case-insensitive regex search in MongoDB
- Limited results for performance

### Data Flow
1. User action triggers API call
2. Backend updates MongoDB
3. Frontend refreshes relevant user data
4. UI updates to reflect new state
